# How to run

1. Clone the project with git
1. Import the project into IntelliJ as "Gradle Project"
1. Make sure you have the IntelliJ [Lombok plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/idea/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin) installed
1. Make sure you have `Enable annotation processing` enabled in the settings
1. For some reasons, IntelliJ deletes launch configurations after import. Please revert such deleted files first (Version Control (Alt+F9) -> Local Changes)
